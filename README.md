## Payload CMS E-commerce Roadmap - Essential Features First

This roadmap outlines the steps to build a basic e-commerce platform using Payload CMS, focusing on essential features first and utilizing Payload CMS terminology.

**Phase 1: Core Product Catalog (Priority 1 - Must Have)**

- **[x] 1. Set up Products Collection:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Collections are like database tables to store structured content.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Create a new Collection in Payload CMS named "Products".
    - Define the following fields within the "Products" Collection:
      - `name` (Field Type: Text): For the product name.
      - `description` (Field Type: Rich Text): For detailed product descriptions (use Payload's visual editor).
      - `images` (Field Type: Upload): For product images (utilize Payload's Media Library).
      - `price` (Field Type: Number): For the product price (consider using a number type with decimal support).
      - `categories` (Field Type: Relationship): To link products to categories (defined in the next step).
      - `product_variations` (Field Type: Blocks): To handle product variations like size, color, etc. (use Payload's Block functionality for structured variations).
        - **[x] 1.x Define "Size Variation" Block:**
          - **Actionable Items:**
            - Within the "Products" Collection configuration, define a new Block named "Size Variation".
            - Add a "Sizes" field (Field Type: Array of Text) to the "Size Variation" Block.
            - Set the `blockName` to "Size Variation" and `blockType` to `sizeVariation` for this Block.
        - **[x] 1.y Define "Color Variation" Block:**
          - **Actionable Items:**
            - Within the "Products" Collection configuration, define a new Block named "Color Variation".
            - Add a "Colors" field (Field Type: Array of Text) to the "Color Variation" Block.
            - Set the `blockName` to "Color Variation" and `blockType` to `colorVariation` for this Block.
        - **[x] 1.z Implement `product_variations` Field:**
          - **Actionable Items:**
            - In the "Products" Collection, create a field named `product_variations` (Field Type: Blocks).
            - Configure the `product_variations` field to accept the "Size Variation" Block (`sizeVariation`) and the "Color Variation" Block (`colorVariation`) as valid block types.
            - _(Optional) Add instructions or descriptions to the `product_variations` field in the Admin UI to guide content editors on how to use these blocks._
- **[x] 2. Set up Categories Collection:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Collections for product categorization.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Create a new Collection in Payload CMS named "Categories".
    - Define the following fields within the "Categories" Collection:
      - `name` (Field Type: Text): For the category name.
      - `slug` (Field Type: Text): For creating user-friendly URLs for categories.
      - `parent_category` (Field Type: Relationship): To create nested categories (optional for the first version, but good to plan for).

**Phase 2: Basic Customer & Order Handling (Priority 2 - Essential for Transactions)**

- **[x] 3. Configure Users Collection for Customers:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Leverage Payload's built-in Users Collection for customer accounts.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Review the default "Users" Collection in Payload CMS.
    - Add the following fields to the "Users" Collection to store customer-specific data:
      - `customer_details` (Field Type: Group): To group customer information.
        - `address` (Field Type: Text)
        - `contact_info` (Field Type: Text)
      - `order_history` (Field Type: Relationship): To link users to their past orders (will be connected to the "Orders" Collection in the next phase).
      - `cart` (Field Type: JSON or Blocks): To temporarily store shopping cart data per user. _(For a simpler initial cart, JSON might suffice. Blocks can offer more structure later)_
    - Focus on enabling basic user registration and login functionality on the front-end.
  - **[x] 3.x Add 'roles' Field to Users Collection:**
    - **Actionable Items:**
      - In the "Users" Collection configuration, add a new field named `roles`.
      - Set the Field Type to `select`.
      - Define the following options for the `select` field: `['customer', 'admin', 'product-manager', 'order-manager', 'content-editor']` (or customize roles as needed).
      - _(Optional) Set a default role, likely 'customer', for new user registrations._
  - **[ ] 3.y Implement Access Control for Roles:**
    - **Actionable Items:**
      - **Define Collection Access Control:**
        - For "Products" and "Categories" Collections: Grant `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` access to 'admin' and 'product-manager' roles. Grant `read` access to 'customer' and public users.
        - For "Orders" Collection: Grant full access to 'admin' and 'order-manager'. Grant `create` access to 'customer' (for placing orders) and `read` access to 'customer' for their own orders only (implement user-specific read access).
        - For "Users" Collection: Grant full access to 'admin'. Grant 'customer' limited access to read and update their own user document only.
        - For "Pages" Collection: Grant full access to 'admin' and 'content-editor'. Grant `read` access to 'customer' and public users.
      - **Define Field-Level Access Control (as needed):**
        - If there are sensitive fields in any collection (e.g., cost price in "Products", detailed user data in "Users"), further refine access control at the field level to restrict read/write access based on roles.
      - **Test Access Control:** Thoroughly test the access control rules to ensure that each role can only access the intended parts of the Payload CMS and perform allowed actions.
- **[ ] 4. Implement Basic Shopping Cart Functionality:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Utilize Payload's API to interact with the "Users" Collection and manage cart data.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Develop front-end logic (React, Vue, etc. - outside Payload scope but crucial) to:
      - Allow users to add products to their cart (stored in the `cart` field of the "Users" Collection).
      - Display cart contents.
      - Update cart quantities.
      - Remove items from the cart.
- **[ ] 5. Set up Orders Collection:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Create a Collection to manage e-commerce orders.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Create a new Collection in Payload CMS named "Orders".
    - Define the following fields within the "Orders" Collection:
      - `user` (Field Type: Relationship): Link each order to a user from the "Users" Collection.
      - `products` (Field Type: Array or Blocks): Store the list of products in the order. Consider:
        - Array of Relationships to "Products" Collection (simpler, but less detail per order item).
        - Blocks for more detailed order items (product, quantity, price at time of order).
      - `total_price` (Field Type: Number): Total order value.
      - `shipping_address` (Field Type: Group): Customer's shipping address.
      - `billing_address` (Field Type: Group): Customer's billing address.
      - `payment_status` (Field Type: Select): Order payment status (e.g., "pending", "paid", "failed").
      - `order_date` (Field Type: Date): Date and time of the order.

**Phase 3: Enhancements & Essential Pages (Priority 3 - Improve User Experience & Store Functionality)**

- **[ ] 6. Integrate Payment Gateway (Stripe Example):**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Use Payload Hooks or create custom API endpoints to integrate with a payment gateway.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Choose a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).
    - Set up server-side integration with the payment gateway using Payload Hooks or custom API endpoints.
    - Implement front-end checkout form to collect payment information.
    - Update the `payment_status` in the "Orders" Collection upon successful payment.

  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Customize the Payload Admin Panel to provide views for:
      - Listing all orders.
      - Viewing individual order details.
      - Updating order statuses (e.g., "processing", "shipped", "completed").
- **[ ] 8. Create Essential Content Pages:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Use Pages Collection or Globals for static content.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Create a "Pages" Collection (if not already existing for other site pages).
    - Define fields for "Pages" Collection: `title`, `slug`, `content` (Rich Text), `layout` (Blocks for flexible layouts).
    - Create at least "About Us" and "Contact" pages using the "Pages" Collection.
- **[ ] 9. Implement Basic SEO Fields:**
  - **Payload Terminology:** Add fields to Collections for SEO metadata.
  - **Actionable Items:**
    - Add SEO-related fields to "Products", "Categories", and "Pages" Collections:
      - `meta_title` (Field Type: Text)
      - `meta_description` (Field Type: Text)
